# Collider Module
A module for collision detection and resoultion

The aim is to make this module for my Suicide King game, and also any other general pygame projects I may work on in the future. Collision detetection sucks, so I want to spend as little time messing with it as possible. Once I get the fundementals, it NEEDS to be gone from my life :/

Am using this: https://gitlab.com/Penaz/2dgd_f0th as a basis for my collision detection techniques, but some of them are really poorly implemented, and the grammar is actually really bad at times lol. Due to a lack of quality, this means that I have to genuinely start from the drawing board in some areas, and has made me way more critical of the whys instead of the hows.
This approach is a bit slow, but I believe this will pay off in the future, since I want to be doing games anyway and these mathematic techniques will probably always have use cases in that field.

Have also been learning so much maths for this its pretty crazy and definitely way too advanced but it's pretty fun figuring out stuff like vector projection, what the dot product actually does, revising on my SOHCAHTOA and just using these tools to solve my vector based problems.
